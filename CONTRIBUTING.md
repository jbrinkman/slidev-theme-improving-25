### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes that require a **Major** version bump (1.0.0), use one of these formats:

1. Add `!` after the type: `feat!: remove deprecated layout`
2. Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

   ```text
   feat: update theme API
   
   BREAKING CHANGE: The theme configuration format has changed.
   See migration guide for details.
   ```

### Examples

#### New Feature (Minor Version Bump)

```text

Add new layout for centered images with caption support.
Includes responsive design and dark mode compatibility.
```

#### Bug Fix (Patch Version Bump)

```text
fix(footer): correct logo positioning in dark mode

incorrect CSS selector specificity.

```

#### Breaking Change (Major Version Bump)

```text
feat!: update component prop names for consistency

BREAKING CHANGE: Component prop names have been updated:
- `showFooter` is now `footer`
- `showPageNumber` is now `pageNumber`
- `showLogo` is now `logo`

Migration: Update your slide frontmatter to use the new prop names.
```

#### Documentation Update (No Version Bump)

Improving logo with custom branding.
```

#### Performance Improvement (Patch Version Bump)

### Scope Guidelines

Use these common scopes to categorize your changes:

- `layouts`: Changes to slide layouts
- `components`: Changes to Vue components
- `styles`: CSS and styling changes
- `setup`: Configuration and setup files
- `deps`: Dependency updates
- `build`: Build system changes

### Tips for Good Commit Messages

1. **Use imperative mood**: "add feature" not "added feature"
2. **Keep the subject line under 50 characters**
3. **Capitalize the subject line**
4. **Don't end the subject line with a period**
5. **Use the body to explain what and why, not how**
6. **Reference issues and pull requests when relevant**

## Code Style

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test your changes across different layouts and themes

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes following the guidelines above
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Commit using conventional commit format
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
7. Ensure all CI checks pass
